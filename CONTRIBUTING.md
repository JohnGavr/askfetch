# Contribution guide
First and foremost, a **big** thank you for even considering to contribute to askfetch.sh! 

There are plenty of ways to help us developing askfetch, from simple tasks such as localization to complex ones such as implementing new features.
This file will serve as a list of those various ways to contribute and will be curated as the project matures.

## Localization (difficulty: `simple`)
Localization helps askfetch.sh reach a broader audience and is considered a simple yet essential contribution task. You can follow our detailed localization [guide](https://github.com/JohnGavr/askfetch/blob/master/documentation/localization.md).
